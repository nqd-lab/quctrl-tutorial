# title-of-paper (arXiv:****.*****)

Your project repo should contain a README.md file with contents to facilitate its navigation. This is the first thing anyone outside of the project will see if they are interested in your code, so make sure it is clean, organized, and easy to follow.

Make sure the README for the Github repo contains all items on the following checklist:
   - table of contents (TOC) for `scr_code/` directory with links to most important functions and classes;
   - short description of structure of repo and code (directories, main files, notebooks, scripts, etc.);
      - in case of multiple functional branches, we need a short description for each in the README of the main branch.
   - misc: mention anything else you find particularly important to run your code.   


----------

Add here the root documentation overview with TOC and directory tree (render using ``` tree structure ```). 

These can be generated using Copilot automatically by asking it to place detailed docstrings in each of your files, and then asking it to generate a markdown documentation. Ask separately for the doctree in markdown and if it messes it up ask it to fix it ;) Make sure to vet the automatically generated docstrings before accepting them.
