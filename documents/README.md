Add any additional but important documents to this directory (for bookkeeping purposes):
   * custom notes with additional info, e.g., derivation of lengthy calculations not presented in the paper, are added as pdf files to suppl_notes/;
   * any unpublished material you consider important for the project is added to unpublished/.

If in the paper we write "unpublished/not shown", mention this expplicitly in the Zenodo record README, and place the material in `docs/unpublished/`.
