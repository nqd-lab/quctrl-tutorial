This directory contains the figures and videos accompanying the manuscript *Taming quantum systems: A tutorial for using shortcuts-to-adiabaticity, quantum optimal control, and reinforcement learning* (arXiv:2501.16436). 

The short videos accompanying the manuscript (see Fig 12 b) can be generated using the Jupyter notebook `src_code/notebooks/reinforcement_learning/PG_quant-env_qubit.ipynb` which uses the Bloch sphere library under `src/Bloch_sphere_lib/`.

All tables can be found in the corresponding `.tex` files under `src_latex/`.

All data is loaded from `../data/raw/`.
